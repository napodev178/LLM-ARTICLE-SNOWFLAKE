The provided code demonstrates the process of registering and deploying a custom machine learning model built with PyTorch for text classification within Snowflake. 
1. Setting Up the Environment:

Lines 1-2: Install the Snowflake ML Python library using conda.
Lines 3-7: Create a sample model registry in Snowflake using the model_registry library.
Lines 8-14: Install PyTorch, torchvision, torchaudio, and the specific PyTorch CUDA version using conda.
2. Loading and Saving the Pre-trained Model:

Lines 16-24: Load a pre-trained Facebook BART large model for MNLI using AutoModelForSequenceClassification and the corresponding tokenizer from Hugging Face Transformers.
Lines 25-29: Save the downloaded model and tokenizer locally to a directory named ARTIFACTS_DIR.
3. Custom Model Class Definition:

Lines 31-42: Define a custom model class FacebookBartLargeMNLICustom inheriting from custom_model.CustomModel.
It initializes the loaded model and tokenizer from the provided paths.
It defines candidate labels (customer support, product experience, account issues) for classification.
The predict method takes a DataFrame with an "input" column and applies the following steps:
Defines a nested function _generate that uses a zero-shot classification pipeline to classify the input text based on the candidate labels.
Iterates through each input text in the DataFrame and calls _generate to get the predicted category.
Returns a DataFrame with the predicted category for each input text.
4. Model Deployment and Usage:

Lines 44-46: Create a model instance using the FacebookBartLargeMNLICustom class, providing the paths to the saved model and tokenizer.
Line 47: Run a sample prediction on a DataFrame containing the text "The interface gets frozen very often".
Lines 49-62: Register the custom model in the Snowflake model registry using model_registry.log_model. This involves specifying:
Model name and version.
The actual model object (cross_model in the code, likely referring to the instantiated FacebookBartLargeMNLICustom class).
Conda dependencies needed to run the model.
Input and output signatures for the prediction method.
Line 64: Load the registered model using the model reference and model name/version.
Line 65: Run another prediction on the same sample DataFrame.
Lines 67-69: Set a dummy metric ("dataset_validation" with accuracy 0.9) for the model and then print all associated metrics (currently only the dummy metric).
